8 Best Places to Buy Ammo Online [2023]
So many online ammo sites! We’ve bought from them all and these are the best. Plus specific recommendations of the best ammo for your caliber and possible shipping restrictions.
So many online ammo websites, right?
Find out the best places to buy ammunition online from our own positive experiences and fails.
.357 Magnum, anyone? (I’ll answer for you: yes, please!)
We’ll also cover recommended brands, types of bullets to buy, what is a “good” price, and unfortunately…restrictions based on your state.
Different Bullet Tips (L TO R: FMJ, Soft, Open, Ballistic)
January 2023 Update: Ammo prices are stabilizing (and even dropping) for popular cartridges. AAC, Blazer, & PMC seem to be the most in-stock varieties.
Steel Ammo
Why Buy Ammo Online?
A survey of gun owners conducted by the NSSF found that 53% of gun owners bought ammo online and that 86% of those cited lower prices and quantity discounts.
Lots of Ammo
I’ve only bought ammo a couple of times at gun stores or the range because I forgot to bring my online bought ammo.
But every time I go, it’s not surprising to see prices 50% higher than what you’ll find online…even after factoring in shipping!

I’d like to also add in variety and tax savings.
Without the restraint of a physical location, online sellers can have tons of selection.
Some guns just like different ammo better than others.  I like to order a couple of types to see what shoots best in a new gun, and then later put in a bulk order.  Plus, our suggestions will likely be out of state for you…so no sales tax!
Why Is There No Ammo?
Short answer is supply and demand.
People started hoarding during the start of the pandemic in March 2020 along with millions of new gun owners who also needed ammo.
Retailers and suppliers are unsure when supply will return as COVID has disrupted global supply chains for ammo components and raw materials. Plus social distancing has slowed down packing operations.
One thing is for sure…if ammo is in stock it’s likely a higher price than before.

They will usually be one of the best prices for cases (1,000) rounds of popular calibers…like .223/5.56, 9mm, and .45 ACP.
Green Tip 5.56 XM855 Penetrator Rounds
And they usually do a good job of keeping the essentials in stock…especially with AAC 9mm.
AAC 115gr 9mm
And sometimes you’ll even find free shipping for cases…otherwise, it may be about $20 to 30 bucks.
Their shipping used to be excruciating slow about ~5 years ago, but now with their in-house firearms selling like hotcakes…they’ve got their ammo shipping down as well.
Speaking of their firearms…they get my stamp of approval for the best entry-level AR-15.

I find a lot of other retailers skimp in website tech or their shipping departments. There have been too many times where the following has happened:
I find a great price, order, my credit card is charged, and then I get an email a couple days later that they are out of stock. Now I can either wait for a backorder or get a refund which ties up my credit card for a week.
I order and it takes a week or two to ship out my order.
I try to see my shipping costs and I have to create a login and enter all my details first.

Other Suggestions
Recommended Ammo Brands
These are just my recommended ammo brands based on price, availability, and what worked in my guns. 
I shoot a decent amount so I usually go for the budget brands. I haven’t had a problem with any of the below.
Popular Pistol Calibers
AAC: Currently the most affordable (and available) for 9mm. Good stuff that has always gone bang.
PMC: Cheap and plentiful rounds that I have used in almost all my calibers. Made in South Korea.
Federal/American Eagle: Also cheap and plentiful rounds made in the USA. I use them interchangeably but word on the street is that AE is Federal’s line that is sold online and in gunshops. Federal Champion is their budget line usually found at Walmart.
Blazer: Another budget brand that sometimes seems too good to be true. Be aware that the super cheap one might be aluminum cased instead of regular brass. I’ve never tried aluminum casings in pistols since I wanted to keep my brass for eventual reloading, but my buddies and I have had no problems in handguns running Blazer Brass.
Tula: My go-to AK round brand. Super cheap with polymer coated steel cases.  Who cares…it’s an AK!
Lake City: While US government-owned, Lake City also sells surplus ammo and brass through a lot of vendors. They also sell parts and supplies to other brands so it’s not uncommon to find ammo from Federal with brass or bullets made by Lake City. All of it is quality stuff!
Others: I’ve also had good success with Sellier & Bellot, and Fiocchi, but they are normally a little higher in price. And if in doubt, just Google the brand and caliber to see if there’s any complains in online gun forums.
Recommended Ammo for Common Calibers
A quick overview of the different calibers and types of bullets out there so you’ll know all the useful acronyms such as FMJ for full metal jacket or JHP for jacket hollow point. 
More Popular Ammo Brands
We’ll also have some suggestions for choosing a self-defense gun as well.
Common Rifle Calibers
Even though we go through 18 calibers in the article above, you’ll probably only see/need a handful of the most common ones. So we’ll start with those first.
223/5.56 Ammo
Daniel Defense AR-15
The round of the super-popular AR-15.
Haven’t gotten one yet? Check out our Definitive Guide to the AR-15.
You can shoot .223 ammo in a 5.56 barrel, but since 5.56 may have higher pressures, you should not shoot them in a .223 barrel.
Popular 5.56 and .223 Ammo
I always get my barrels in 5.56 so there is no problem. Ammo is around 25-40 cents each at the most standard 55 gr bullet.
You’ll also see some designations of XM and M followed by 193 or 855 for Federal & American Eagle.
XM means it was rejected from military use for some reason but still meets commercial specifications. M means it meets mil-spec. 193 means it is a 55-grain FMJ-BT (boat tail) while 855 is 62-grain FMJ-BT with a steel penetrator for added penetration against hardened targets.
M855 Cutaway, Bearingarms.com
We cover everything in even more detail in Best AR-15 Ammo for Self-Defense & Range. But here are some of our picks.
Our favorite XM193 and XM855 ammo!

And our favorite range plinking round goes to PMC Bronze since the brass is great for reloading and it’s a little softer shooting than the others (perfect for competition).

9mm Ammo
9mm 147 Federal Hydrashok HST
I’ve shot over 10,000 rounds of 9mm before I started reloading for competitions.  
Price is around 30 cents a round. I prefer 124-grain instead of 115-grain which seems snappier in recoil, but I recommend trying out both to see which one you like better.
9mm (115gr vs 124gr vs 147gr)
I also recommend sticking with brass cartridges instead of cheaper aluminum/steel.
We cover everything in Best 9mm Ammo for Self-Defense & Range. But here’s a couple of our favorites…
Popular 9mm Ammo
For general purpose self-defense…we like the 124-grain Federal HST.

I also really like CCI Blazer 9mm that is brass cased.

.45 ACP Ammo
.45 ACP Ball vs Hollowpoint
I’ve shot over 2,500 rounds of 45 ACP and also go with my standard budget list of manufacturers. Price is around 40-50 cents a round. 
There’s not too much variation in weight so I stick with the standard 230-grain.
The extensive list is at Best .45 ACP Ammo for Home Defense & Target Practice but here is our main pick.
Popular .45 ACP Ammo
For self-defense, the HST passed the FBI ballistics gelatin test with flying colors…dominating in penetration and expansion.
BEST .45 ACP SELF-DEFENSE
Federal .45 ACP 230 gr HST
43
at Brownells
Prices accurate at time of writing
.22 LR Ammo
Reasonably priced .22 LR ammo is getting easier to find at <8 cents a round.
.22LR (CCI vs Winchester vs Super Colibri)
So what is out there (and in stock) is much more expensive. 
We’ve compiled an extensive list in Best .22 LR Ammo for Accuracy, Plinking, & Hunting.
Popular .22LR Ammo
But…the CCI at 40-grain is my go-to for .22 LR in my Ruger 10/22.
AGUILA 22 LONG RIFLE AMMUNITION 500 – 1000 Rds (Likely in stock but expensive)
WINCHESTER 22 LONG RIFFLE AMMUNITION 500Rds
Victory .22 Long Rifle 40 Grain Round Nose 500 Rounds
7.62×39 Ammo
Assorted 7.62×39 (FMJ, Open, Soft, FMJ)
The good ole AK-47 rounds. My rule is to go with ammo from countries that used the AK but to watch out for corrosive ammunition (which is pretty good shooting stuff, you just need to put more effort in cleaning afterward).
You also need to check with your shooting range rules to see if they allow magnetic (bi-metal) or non-brass ammunition such as Wolf/Tula.
Popular 7.62×39 Ammo
If they don’t, you will have to go with more expensive brands or corrosive ammunition.  The general weight is around 122-grain and costs from 25 to 35 cents each. Brass cartridges will be more.
.308/7.62x51mm Ammo
Assorted 7.62x51mm (MEN 147gr, PPU 165gr, PPU 180gr, Gold Medal 168gr
Another of those rounds that are almost identical but with some differences in pressure and dimensions. 
Unless you really know what you are doing, keep using the round intended for your rifle.
Popular .308 Winchester and 7.62x51mm Ammo
Since most 308/7.62x51mm ammo will be in long-range (sniper) rifles, we’ll also include some Match ammo.
Most commercial ammo will be around 147-grains and around 60 to 70 cents each while match ammo is around 168-grains and $1.50 per round. I went almost straight into reloading to get the max accuracy out of my guns so take my suggestions with a grain of salt.
7.62x51mm Ammo
308/7.62x51mm Self Defense
Federal Power Shok – 500 Rounds – 180 gr SP
Hornady Superformance – 500 Rounds – 120 gr
Shotgun Ammo
12ga Shotgun Shells, Opened (L to R: Bird, Buck, Slug)
The shotgun is unique since there are so many different types of ammunition.
We’ll cover basic target birdshot (#8-#9 is great for clay shooting), buckshot, and slugs.  Remember for birdshot, the larger the #, the smaller the pellets. And that 00 (double-aught) buckshot is great for self-defense while slugs are one solid piece of lead.
Popular 12ga Shotgun Ammo
2-3/4 inch refers to the length of the shell which will fit almost all 12ga shotguns. The problem arises from 3 inch magnum shells.
Prices will vary from 25 cents for target shots to around 50 cents — $1 for buckshot and slugs.  I’ve shot tons of Fiocchi and Estate birdshot, and love the Winchester Military Buckshot.
Winchester 12ga 00 Buckshot
Self-Defense Shotgun Rounds
Sellier & Bellot, .410 Gauge 2 1/2″ 000 Buckshot 3 Pellets, 500 Rounds
Kent Cartridge 12 Gauge 2.75 in 1 3/8 oz 5 Shot Shell Ultimate Fast Lead 500 Rds (What I prefer)
